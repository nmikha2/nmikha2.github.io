	A quick Summary about me is that I grew up in Ukraine and moved to Chicago when I was about 4 years old.
	I am currently a Junior in UIUC and over the past years I have really learned to fall in love with this 
	school. I hope to finish with my degrees on time, and my end goal is to get into the school of Financial
	Engineering here at UIUC. I eventually want to work as a Quantitative  Analyst at some fancy firm in 
	Chicago.
